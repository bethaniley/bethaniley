# 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Bethan.
*Pronounced: Beth-Anne Eye-Lee.*

I'm a PhD student in Psychology at Queen's University Belfast. My research interests lie in the social psychology of (anti-)science beliefs and behaviours. That means questions like:
- How do social identities affect what people believe about science?
- Why do people reject science, and especially believe anti-scientific conspiracy theories?
- How do social processes affect the ways scientists implement scientific methods?

My other research interests are in equality, diversity and inclusion (especially neurodiversity); political beliefs and behaviours; how people think about and behave towards non-human animals; and creating behaviour change to address big problems.

When I'm not PhD-ing, I'm a Finance Administrator and OSPARK Coordinator at [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org/)! I'm also involved in open science, metascience, and science communicaiton projects.

### 📊 Current projects

My repositories are mostly centred around R and Markdown documentation. This means:

- PhD analysis code.
- Trialling using GitHub in projects which are not code-based, e.g. personal notes.
- A few other secret projects!

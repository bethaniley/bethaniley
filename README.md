# 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Bethan.

I'm a PhD student in Psychology at Queen's University Belfast. My pronouns are she/her. My research focusses on developing a game-based training intervention which (hopefully!) changes negative attitudes towards gender equality initiatives. I'm currently learning R and C#, and refreshing my webdev knowledge.

### 📊 Current projects

- The currently unnamed game-based training intervention
- [somethingstochastic.com](https://somethingstochastic.com/), a personal website with [Dominik Kiersz](https://github.com/DAKiersz)

All my projects are currently private.

# 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Bethan.
*Pronounced: Beth-anne Eye-lee.*

I'm a PhD student in Psychology at Queen's University Belfast. My research focusses on developing a game-based training intervention which (hopefully!) changes negative attitudes towards gender equality initiatives. I'm currently learning R and C#, and refreshing my webdev knowledge.

### 📊 Current projects

- The currently unnamed game-based training intervention
- A Shiny App for [FORRT](https://forrt.org/)

All my projects are currently private.

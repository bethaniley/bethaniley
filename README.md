# 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Bethan.
*Pronounced: Beth-Anne Eye-Lee.*

I'm a PhD student in Psychology at Queen's University Belfast. My research interests lie in the social psychology of (un)scientific beliefs and behaviours. That means questions like:
- How do social identities affect what people believe about science?
- Why do people reject science, and especially believe anti-scientific conspiracy theories?
- How do social processes affect the ways scientists implement scientific methods?

My other research interests are in neurodiversity, how people think about non-human animals, and creating behaviour change to address big problems.

When I'm not PhD-ing, I'm a Finance Manager at OLS!

### 📊 Current projects

My repositories are centred around R and markdown documentation. This means:

- PhD analysis code.
- Trialling using GitHub in projects which are not code-based, e.g. personal notes.
- A few other secret projects!
